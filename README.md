# About the project

It is crucial to advertise your product to the right group of customers whose needs closely match your product. This is called target marketing. To help achieve this goal, we developed 4 algorithms using the UCI bank marketing dataset.

The 4 used algorithms are:
* Naive Bayes Gaussian
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forrest Classifier
* LightGBM

# Recommended tools:
* Python version: `3.10.8`

* Pip version: `22.2.2`


To install all dependencies, run: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).
